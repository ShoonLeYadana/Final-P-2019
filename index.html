  <p>The name of my country is <a href="https://bit.ly/2RgVxt6">Myanmar</a> or you can also call it Burma.It is not a very famous 
   country, some people might not even heard of it, that is why I would like to introduce it to you guys.
   <p>It is a country located in the Southeast Asia, about 74% of the populition is Buddhist and Christain being the second 
    runner up and other <a href="https://bit.ly/2IgMvJK">religions</a> as well as Muslim and Hindu.
  <p>The country is a Buddhist country so there are pagodas and temples everywhere.

   capital,<a href="https://bit.ly/2WCqx7W">Yangon</a> are one of the most famous cities in Burma.
  <p>The city that I live in is <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZCl6rv">Mandalay</a> which is the second largest city in Burma and was the
   last <a href="https://bit.ly/2L2GphK">royal capital</a>.

   <p>Since Burma is a Buddhism country it is filled with golden shimmering pagodas, the popular pagodas include, 
    <a href="https://bit.ly/2KtJ3Of" "https://bit.ly/2XZoD2G">Shwedagon Pagoda</a>, the most popular pagoda of all the other,
    <a href="https://dailym.ai/2KnU9nK">Kyite HteeYoe Pagoda</a> which is a pagoda filled with amazements because the pagoda is actually 
     <a href="https://bit.ly/2WQNUeb">a rock hanging on a cliff barely even touching the ground</a>
    and has never caused any acidents to the travelers who takes so many risks to get to the top of the pagoda.
   <p>Another very famous pagoda is <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZAevhk">the Maha Bawdi tataung</a> with it's standing and laying down 
    structure of the Budda.
    <p>There is also a very interesting place that you must visit if you come to Burma, it is called <a href="https://bit.ly/2FloL5i">Inlay</a>
     ,a city built over water, very famous  for <a href="https://bit.ly/2L4KRge">paddleing their boats and fishing with their feets!</a>
     <p>Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar.
    <p>Myanmar also have some of the breathtaking beaches, which are
     <ul>
